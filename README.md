# Recipies-Bot
## Description
I created this telegram-bot as test-unit for my own telegram-library
I'll probably publish this library here, when I will be sure, what it works corectly
It takes some data from [THIS web-site](https://www.themealdb.com/) and shows it to user
## User
User can make request to telegram bot, like 
> "I want to make something to breakfast"

or
> "I want to make something from potato"

## P.S.
In "*ApiHandler.cs*" there are 40 properties in the class "*Receipe*", just trust me it's true.
I dont know how to realise it better, so if you can, please, open Issue and tell me
